Creating a panable and zoomable recruitment tree for an adult softball league

## Introduction
A sql database of player data was used to build an undirected spring model using the Scalable Force-Directed Placement (sfdp) engine in the GraphViz library in Python. The resultant vector file (.svg) was later prettied up and printed on a 3' x 4' banner for a reunion event. The static file was too large to share normally at the resolution required to read any of the names, however. This project used the [anvaka/panzoom](https://github.com/anvaka/panzoom) approach to create a pannable and scaleable version of the banner that is accessable from both a desktop and mobile device.
